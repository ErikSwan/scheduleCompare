This is the first release of scheduleCompare, a PHP-based web application that allows students
to compare school schedules quickly and easily.

There is still a lot of site-specific code (mainly HTML and CSS), and the back-end code is in 
an absolutely horrible state, with no OOP or proper programming practices whatsoever.

To install this, upload all the files to the directory of your choosing, then
create a new MySQL database using the tool of your choice and import the db_schema.sql
file through phpMyAdmin or another tool. The db_schema.sql file contains values for the classes
and teachers at Eden Prairie High School. You will need to clear these and populate the database
with the appropriate data if you're going to use it with another school.

You will need to set the appropriate variables in includes/config.php. The base domain is important
for cookies, sessions, and various redirects to work correctly. You'll also want
to generate a long random value for the salt.

I will provide more detailed instructions in the future, this is just a quickie.

To install this, upload all the files to the directory of your choosing, then
create a new MySQL database using the tool of your choice and import the erik_schedules.sql
file through phpMyAdmin or another tool.

Set the appropriate variables in includes/config.php. The base domain is important
for cookies, sessions, and various redirects to work correctly. You'll also want
to generate a long random value for the salt. :)

I will provide more detailed instructions in the future, this is just a quickie.

There is lots to do and many ways in which the current code could
be improved. Some quick items off the top of my head:

- Add commenting system
- Fix select field bugs with Chrome/IE on the edit schedule page
  (remove them instead of hiding - keeped cloned copy to restore)
- Replace everything with autosuggest?
- Implement forgot password functionality
- Rewrite using OOP
- Approved members/"friends"
